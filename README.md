# LargeLanguageMind
A process-driven research journal tracing how my evolving understanding of intelligence, cognition, and machine learning emerges—from intuition, cross-domain connections, and reasoning, to formal concepts.

## My Method
This journal is intentionally **process-based** rather than product-based.
Entries document the **development of ideas**: initial intuitions, informal reasoning, analogies, confusions, revisions, and only later connections to established theory and research.
The goal is not to present novel results or authoritative explanations, but to externalize a **thinking process**—how abstract patterns **across fields** are recognized, explored, tested, corrected, and sometimes abandoned.
In this sense, the journal sits between intuition and academia: not a tutorial, not a paper, but a **record of reasoning** under uncertainty.
